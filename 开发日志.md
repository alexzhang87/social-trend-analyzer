# Development Log

## August 15, 2025

### Features Implemented
- **Enhanced Emotion Analysis:** Implemented a detailed emotion analysis chart in the trend details modal, breaking down sentiment into Joy, Sadness, Anger, Sarcasm, and Neutral. This provides deeper insights into the qualitative aspects of each trend.

### Future Features & Todos
- **Media Share Chart (Postponed):** A media share pie chart was developed to show the distribution of trends between X and Reddit. This feature has been temporarily removed from the UI as per user feedback, because the current number of sources (only two) is not sufficient to make this chart highly valuable.
  - **Action Item:** Re-implement the `MediaShareCard` component when more data sources are added to the platform. The component code is saved in version history and can be quickly restored.

## August 15, 2025 (Afternoon Session) - Major UI/UX Overhaul

### Features Implemented
- **Dynamic Keyword Cloud:** Replaced the static keyword list on the main results page with an interactive word cloud (`WordCloudPanel`). This provides a much more intuitive and visually appealing way to identify high-frequency terms at a glance.
- **Professional Trend List Redesign:** Completely overhauled the `TrendList` component. It now uses a professional, information-rich card layout for each trend, significantly improving data density and scannability. Each card now clearly displays the hot score, category, keywords, and a mini trend chart.
- **Enhanced Evidence Cards:** Redesigned the "Evidence" section within the trend detail modal to mimic the professional "Top Mentions" cards from the PDF report. Each evidence card now includes a user avatar, author, platform, sentiment badge, and simulated engagement metrics (likes/comments), making the data feel more authentic and insightful.

### Future Features & Todos (From PDF Analysis)
- **Geography & Language Distribution:** Add a new "Audience" tab to the trend modal to display the geographical and linguistic distribution of mentions. (Postponed)
- **Core Reach & Engagement Metrics:** Enhance the main `OverviewCards` to include "Social Reach" and "Social Engagement" as top-level KPIs. (Postponed)
